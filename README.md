Introduction:
Wine has always been a popular beverage for centuries, and its popularity continues to grow worldwide. Some drink it for leisure and some drink it for the proposed health benefits associated with wine. No matter the reason, wine consumption has been on the rise. [In 2011, 2.7 gallons of wine on average were consumed per resident, totally 847 million gallons of wine consumed. A decade later, in 2021, these numbers increased to 3.18 gallons per resident with 1.1 billion gallons of wine consumed.](https://wineinstitute.org/our-industry/statistics/us-wine-consumption/) With innovative methods utilized in the wine industry to maintain consumer interest and garner attentions of curious drinkers, it is very clear that the demand and interest of wine will only continue to rise every year. The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between wine prices, country of origin, vintage rating, and wine rating to determine which factors have the greatest impact on the price of a bottle of wine. This analysis will provide valuable insights for wine enthusiasts and investors alike.

Our objectives are to:

- Analyze the correlation between wine prices and their country of origin.
- Examine the relationship between wine prices and vintage ratings.
- Investigate the impact of wine ratings on wine prices.
- Provide insights and recommendations for wine enthusiasts and investors.

Methodology:
To achieve the project objectives, R will be used to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset and visualizations will be created to make the results easy to interpret. Regression analysis will also be performed to determine the factors that have the greatest impact on wine prices.

Conclusion:
This project aims to analyze the relationships between wine prices, country of origin, vintage rating, and wine rating. By examining these factors, the hope is to provide valuable insights into the factors that affect the price of a bottle of wine. This analysis will be useful for wine enthusiasts to make informed decisions on which wine is most worth their money and value. It will also be useful for investors looking to decide which winery to best invest their money. Businesses can also benefit from this data analysis by deciding which wine to produce, make, or if the price and quality of wine is competitive in the market.
