Story:

Inspired by Hasan Minhaj's show 'Patriot Act', the story I intend to tell is how the expansion of American's fast food companies are contributing to health anomolies around the world. Often times, the world 'obesity' is associated with Americans due to the image of the 'American diet', which is composed of burgers, pizzas, and french fries. This diet, popularized by the influence of fast food chains, contributed to the rising obesity rate in America. But not a lot of discussion is around how globalization of these popular fast food chains have effected not only obesity, but heart diseases and diabetes around the world. It is important to recognize obesity isn't just based on lack of exercise alone but also the food you eat. While it's true that obesity is a multifaceted issue that can encompass poverty, food desert, income, and other factors related to daily lifestyle, this project aims to examine how fast food chains contributes to obesity not just through consumption but also its placements in communities compared to grocery stores or markets and how the food prices compared to local restaurants and eateries. In the episode 'How America is Causing Global Obesity', Hasan mentioned political influence of big brand name companies such as Coca Cola, trade deals, and popularization of high fructose corn syrup as some of the factors for obesity in countries such as Mexico and Brazil. In our analysis, we will only focus on fast food chains rather than products of individual companies (i.e. Coca Cola, Pepsi). The fast food chains that will be included in this analysis will be McDonald's, Starbucks, and Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). The health metrics that will be analyzed includes obesity, diabetes, and stroke. This project aims to tell a comprehensive story and visualization of the before and after the introduction of fast food chains and effects it has on the population's health outcomes.
