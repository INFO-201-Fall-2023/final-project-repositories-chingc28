ory Pitch
Your project proposal will include a "story pitch" or "elevator pitch" where you will briefly describe (~500 words) A) what is the story you intend to tell/visualize and B) why that is an interesting and compelling story. Your pitch should make a clear argument about why someone would care about your story and why they might find it interesting. 

Some Advice: 
How to tell if you have an original/interesting story idea? You should answer "yes" to the many of the questions below:

1. Is this topic so new and original that you can't find any books written on the subject? 

2. Does this topic deal with fundamental life issues such as death, love, sickness, money, careers, health -- issues that affect millions of people? 

3. Do you have a strong, central unifying theme? 

4. Can you state your theme in one sentence using an action verb? 

5. Does your angle allow you to offer intelligent insight -- as opposed to saying something that is obvious, that's common sense or that people have read about many times? 

6. Are there elements of drama or conflict to attract and sustain the reader? 

7. Does your theme question or contradict what most people think or assume? 

 

Finding Data
To start, youâ€™ll need to find a dataset or datasets that are interesting and which you think will provide a fertile bed for an interesting or even newsworthy visualization-based story. Finding data can be very time consuming, so please start on this as soon as possible (you might start with https://app.enigma.io/searchLinks to an external site. or http://data.govLinks to an external site.). The data can be national or local, or something else entirely, but try to find something that might have some news value or interest.

Your final project will require you to work with two independent datasets that come from two independent sources.

Example: 

Bad: School enrollment dataset and school geospatial (lat/lng) location dataset both from the Department of Education.
Good: Income per capita dataset and geographic shapes from the Census, and test score results and school geospatial location from the Department of Education.
At this stage your group should identify and download two independent sources of data. In your project proposal, you will then describe both datasets by answering the following questions: 

Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
How many observations (rows) are in your data?
How many features (columns) are in the data?
 

Background Research/Inspiration
Finally, your proposal should include sources of inspiration/background research that you've found on the web. These can be new articles, blog posts, or even interactive visualizations. In your proposal please include the following: 

List no fewer than 5 URLs of articles and other web applications that share common goals and/or features with your proposed project idea.
And for each of the 5 listed inspirations from above, write at least two bullet point items comparing and contrasting your project idea with the given inspiration.
